				<h3>1. Search by Image</h3>

			 	<h3>2. Search Tools</h3>
			 	<p>Google Search Tools let users search with a greater depth of context. Can’t remember the exact site you visited but remember the content?  Change the results to only show pages you’ve visited. Curious what results you’d get if you were searching last year? Change the time filter to a custom range and take a step back in time. </p>

				<h3>4. Specify Searches</h3>
				<p>Slight modifications to your Google query can help make your searches more accurate. For example, adding quotation marks around a phrase will only return results with the exact quote. Also, adding a hyphen before a word will remove the search term. This can be very helpful for removing unwanted results. Another example is adding “site:”, which allows you to search from within a given domain.</p>
